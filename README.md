# 02456 Deep Learning (with PyTorch)

This repository contains exercises for the DTU course [02456 Deep Learning](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02456). All exercises are written in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and formatted into [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). If you are unfamiliar with notebooks, it can be a good idea to familiarize yourself with them in advance.

This repository borrows heavily from previous works, in particular:

* [2015 DTU Summerschool in Deep Learning](https://github.com/DeepLearningDTU/Summerschool_2015/tree/master/day1-NN). A PhD summerschool that was held at DTU in 2015. Exercises both in **numpy** and **Theano**.

* [02456-deep-learning](https://github.com/DeepLearningDTU/02456-deep-learning). Previous version of the course material for this course, but using **TensorFlow** for the exercises.

* [Pytorch Tutorial](https://github.com/munkai/pytorch-tutorial). A remix popular deep learning materials, including material from 02456, collected in one coherent package using **PyTorch**, with a focus on natural language processing (NLP)

* [pytorch/tutorials](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials). Official tutorials from the PyTorch repo.

## Setup
The **recommended** (and by far the easiest) way to get started with the exercises is by using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). It allows you to work with Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud with all pre-installed dependencies, and Colab offers free GPU access, enabling you to run the exercises considerably faster. Also, all exercises have been tested on Colab.

If you prefer to work locally, we recommend using either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) (for both Linux, Mac, and Windows). On Linux, you can use the system Python, and on Mac, you can also use a newer version of Python through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

To run on the [DTU HPC](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk), please see the guide on the course homepage.
